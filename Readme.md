<h1 align="center">Practical Software Engineer final project: Tours-Company</h1>
<h3>Project description</h3>
<p>
My final project at Practical Software Engineer study at Technological College.
There are uses of object-oriented programming, encryption and making PDF documents.
Clients can register, update their information, order/cancel/pay for a tour, and get information about their purchase history. The client gets a message about unpaid orders 14 days before the tour starts and other messages about unpaid past tours.
Workers can add/search/charge/active/deactivate clients, add tours, purchase tours for clients, and purchase history. The worker gets a message about unpaid orders 14 days before the tour starts and other messages about unpaid past tours.
PDF creation for receipts about payments, ID documents for clients/workers/tours that present all of the purchase‚Äôs history (paid, unpaid, cancelled), information about a specific tour, and flight tickets.
